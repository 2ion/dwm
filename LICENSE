dynamic window manager is designed like any other X client as well. It
is driven through handling X events. In contrast to other X clients, a
window manager selects for SubstructureRedirectMask on the root window,
to receive events about window (dis-)appearance.  Only one X connection
at a time is allowed to select for this event mask.

The event handlers of dwm are organized in an array which is accessed
whenever a new event has been fetched. This allows event dispatching in
O(1) time.

Each child of the root window is called a client, except windows which
have set the override_redirect flag.  Clients are organized in a linked
client list on each monitor, the focus history is remembered through a
stack list on each monitor. Each client contains a bit array to indicate
the tags of a client.

Keys and tagging rules are organized as arrays and defined in config.h.

To understand everything else, start reading main().
