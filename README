README
======

This repository contains a patched and further modified version of the
DWM window manager I use. The code is based on DWM 6.0 and some patches
(see below). I try to keep the code on the master branch in a
compileable state. Development is being done on all other branches -
these are not intended to be used in a production environment!

PATCHES & MODIFICATIONS
=======================

    'OFFICIAL' PATCHES
    ------------------

        * pushstack
        * cycletag

    PERSONAL MODS
    -------------

        * Use XkbKeycodeToKeysym() instead of XKeycodeToKeysym()
        * mpdcmd() callback to directly control mpd. Linked against
          libmpdclient for playback & volume (raise, lower, mute/unmute)
        * DCMD() macro for convenient dmenu invocation
        * Compile with -O2 instead of -Os

        * Lua rc interface to modify dwm configuration without restart
        * Lua interface to pre-defined dwm sessions

    WISHLIST
    --------

        * Use code from tmux for direct control
        * Volume control via libalsa. For that, add a callback alsa()
